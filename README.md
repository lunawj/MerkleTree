to show you how to install openssl on your device. Then make sure to link the libraries with the flags

-lcrypto
-lssl

if you are using a gcc compiler.

You need 10 files named

file.c
file2.c
file3.c
file4.c
file5.c
file6.c
file7.c
file8.c
file9.c
file10.c

to run the test function in the program. It needs to be in the same folder as the code. The test function will hash those files to make a Merkle Tree.

The file you will insert also need to be in the same folder as the code. Make sure to enter the full name when you insert a file. For example, to insert file.c, enter file.c.

Note: md5 hashes the contents of files, not file names.
